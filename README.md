- Prioritize tools with clear upgrade paths. This allows you to start free and scale as your project grows.
- Engage with tool communities. Many offer support, resources, and sometimes credits or discounts for active community members.

3. Q: Are the free tiers of these tools sufficient for launching an MVP?
   A: In many cases, yes. However, it depends on your specific project requirements. Always check the limitations of free tiers.

4. Q: Have you tested all these tools?
   A: Not all of them! But I've tested a little bit more than half of them and I'm using some of them in my own projects. I've also used the free tiers of many of these tools to launch side projects or at my day job.
